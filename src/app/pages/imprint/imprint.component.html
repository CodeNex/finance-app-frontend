      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>Liability for content</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        The contents of our pages were created with the greatest care. However, we
        cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the
        content. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on
        these pages according to § 7 Abs.1 DDG under general laws. According to §§
        8 to 10 DDG, we are not obligated as a service provider to monitor
        transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate
        circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or
        block the use of information under general laws remain unaffected.
        However, liability in this regard is only possible from the time of
        knowledge of a specific infringement. Upon becoming aware of such
        violations, we will remove this content immediately.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Liability for links</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose
        contents we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability
        for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the
        pages is always responsible for the contents of the linked pages. The
        linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of
        linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of linking. A
        permanent content control of the linked pages is not reasonable without
        concrete evidence of a violation of the law. Upon becoming aware of legal
        violations, we will remove such links immediately.
      </p>

      <h3>Data protection</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        The use of our website is usually possible without providing personal
        data. Insofar as personal data (for example, name, address, or email
        addresses) are collected on our pages, this is always done on a voluntary
        basis as far as possible. These data will not be passed on to third
        parties without your express consent.
        <br />
        We point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., communication
        by email) can have security gaps. A complete protection of the data from
        access by third parties is not possible.
        <br />
        The use of contact data published within the framework of the imprint
        obligation by third parties for sending unsolicited advertising and
        information materials is hereby expressly prohibited. The operators of the
        pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of
        unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as spam emails.

      <br>
      <h4>Who is responsible for the data collection on this website?</h4>

      <p>
        The data processing on this website is carried out by the website
        operator. The operator's contact details can be found in the section

      <p>
        Your data is collected on the one hand when you provide it to us. This

      </p>
      <p>
        Other data is collected automatically or with your consent when you visit
        the website through our IT systems. This data primarily includes technical
        data (e.g., internet browser, operating system, or the time of the page
        access). This data is collected automatically as soon as you enter this
        website.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>What do we use your data for?</h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        Part of the data is collected to ensure error-free provision of the
        website. Other data can be used to analyze your user behavior. If
        contracts can be concluded or initiated via the website, the transmitted
        data will also be processed for contract offers, orders, or other
        inquiries.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>What rights do you have regarding your data?</h4>
      <br>

        You have the right at any time to receive free information about the
        origin, recipient, and purpose of your stored personal data. You also have
        the right to request the correction or deletion of this data. If you have
        given your consent to data processing, you can revoke this consent at any
        time for the future. Furthermore, you have the right, under certain
        circumstances, to demand the restriction of the processing of your
        personal data. Additionally, you have the right to lodge a complaint with
        the competent supervisory authority.
      </p>
      <p>

      <br>
      <p>We host the content of our website with the following provider:</p>
      <br>
      <h3>IONOS</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        The provider is IONOS SE, Elgendorfer Str. 57, 56410 Montabaur

        any time.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>3. General Information and Mandatory Information</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>Data Protection</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data
        very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in
        accordance with statutory data protection regulations and this privacy
        policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you use this website, various personal data is collected. Personal
        data refers to data that can personally identify you. This privacy policy
        explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how
        and for what purpose this is done.
      </p>
      <p>
        We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g.
        communication by e-mail) can have security gaps. A complete protection of
        data against access by third parties is not possible.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Information on the Responsible Party</h3>
      <br>
      <p>The responsible party for data processing on this website is:</p>
      <p>
        Richard Streu<br />
        Schenkendorfstraße 24<br />
        09322 Penig
      </p>
      <br>
      <a href="mailto:contact@code-nex.de">contact&#64;code-nex.de</a>
      <br>
      <p>
        The responsible party is the natural or legal person who, alone or jointly
        with others, decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data
        (e.g., names, e-mail addresses, etc.).
      </p>
  
      <br>
      <h3>Storage Duration</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        Unless a specific storage period has been specified within this privacy
        policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for
        processing the data no longer applies. If you assert a legitimate request
        for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be
        deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your
        personal data (e.g., tax or commercial retention periods); in the latter
        case, the deletion will take place after these reasons cease to apply.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>General Information on Data Processing on This Website</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        If you have given your consent to data processing, we will process your
        personal data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR if
        special categories of data are processed in accordance with Art. 9(1)
        GDPR. In the event of an explicit consent to the transfer of personal data
        to third countries, data processing is also based on Art. 49(1)(a) GDPR.
        If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to information
        on your end device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), data processing is
        also based on § 25(1) TDDG. Consent can be revoked at any time. If your
        data is required for the fulfillment of a contract or for the
        implementation of pre-contractual measures, we will process your data on
        the basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR. Furthermore, we will process your data if
        this is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation on the basis of Art.
        6(1)(c) GDPR. Data processing may also be carried out on the basis of our
        legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The relevant legal
        bases in each individual case are provided in the following paragraphs of
        this privacy policy.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        In the course of our business activities, we work with various external
        entities. In some cases, it is necessary to transfer personal data to
        these external entities. We only pass on personal data to external
        entities if this is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract, if we are
        legally obliged to do so (e.g., disclosure of data to tax authorities), if
        we have a legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR in the
        disclosure, or if another legal basis permits the data transfer. When
        using processors, we only pass on personal data of our customers on the
        basis of a valid contract for order processing. In the case of joint
        processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        Many data processing operations are only possible with your express
        consent. You can revoke your consent at any time. The legality of the data
        processing carried out before the revocation remains unaffected by the
        revocation.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>
        Right to Object to the Collection of Data in Special Cases and to Direct
        Advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)
      </h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        IF DATA PROCESSING IS CARRIED OUT ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6(1)(E) OR (F)
        GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA
        AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO
        APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS
        ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU
        OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN
        DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING THAT OVERRIDE
        YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS OR FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT, EXERCISE,
        OR DEFENSE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(1) GDPR).
      </p>
      <p>
        IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT ADVERTISING,
        YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL
        DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH ADVERTISING; THIS ALSO APPLIES
        TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU
        OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE
        PURPOSE OF DIRECT ADVERTISING (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(2) GDPR).
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to
        lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the
        Member State of their habitual residence, place of work, or place of the
        alleged violation. The right to lodge a complaint is without prejudice to
        other administrative or judicial remedies.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis
        of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a
        third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the
        direct transfer of the data to another responsible party, this will only
        be done to the extent that it is technically feasible.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Information, Correction, and Deletion</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the
        right to free information about your stored personal data, its origin and
        recipient, and the purpose of data processing and, if necessary, a right
        to correct or delete this data. For this and other questions on the topic
        of personal data, you can contact us at any time.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your
        personal data. To do so, you can contact us at any time. The right to
        restrict processing exists in the following cases:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored with us, we
          usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the examination,
          you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your
          personal data.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request
          the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.
        </li>
        <li>
          If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the
          exercise, defense, or assertion of legal claims, you have the right to
          request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead
          of deletion.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, a balance
          must be struck between your interests and ours. As long as it is not yet
          clear whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the
          restriction of the processing of your personal data.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data –
        apart from their storage – may only be processed with your consent or for
        the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the
        protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons
        of important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>SSL or TLS Encryption</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential
        content, such as orders or inquiries that you send to us as the website
        operator, this site uses SSL or TLS encryption. You can recognize an
        encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser
        changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your
        browser line.
      </p>
      <p>
        If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot
        be read by third parties.
